# filesize package for Visual Studio Code

This package is intended for use with the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor and it displays the size of the focused file in the status bar of the editor.

**Bonus:** If you click on the status bar component it will display more information about the file!

## Installation

In VS Code, press Ctrl-P or Cmd-P (Mac) and type in `ext install vscode-filesize`. Click install in the left bar. Once the extension is installed you will be prompted to restart Visual Studio Code.
